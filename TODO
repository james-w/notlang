- bytecode mechanism to handle more constants, longs jumps etc. (remove 255 limit)
- Maybe type in stdlib that works with A | None inference.
- Checking that a type var in a declaration is valid. (foo(a: a) when a is used as an int.)
- Maybe move the List = new Type: coalescing in to the parser, rather than doing it in the type-checker and compiler.
- Typing enhancements
- Exceptions
- Displaying source code on problems (tracebacks with source)
- JIT
- Pattern match totality analysis
