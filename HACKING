Getting started
---------------

  make package-deps
  make deps

You can try running the test file with

  virtualenv/bin/python targetnotlang.py test.not

Tests
-----

You can run all the tests with

  make test

Translating
-----------

To get a native JIT interpreter for the language run

  make build

and cross your fingers.

Parsing
-------

To help debug parsing you can run

  virtualenv/bin/not-view-raw-parse-tree <FILE>

to see the raw parse tree from the rpython lexer/parser, or

  virtualenv/bin/not-view-parse-tree <FILE>

to see the AST produced from the raw parse tree.

Typechecking
------------

To get a dump of the inferred types of the functions
in a file run

  virtualenv/bin/not-dump-type-info <FILE>

Compiling
---------

To see the bytecode produced for the top level as a file try

  virtualenv/bin/not-dump-bytecode <FILE>

Debugging
---------

You can use -D to specify components to debug when running the main target.

To find out what you can pass to this see the list in --help.

Some of note are

  - -Derror to show all tracebacks
  - -Dlexer to show the incremental results of the lexer
  - -Dinterp to get tracing from the interpreter as it works.
  - -Dtype to get debug output from the type checker.
